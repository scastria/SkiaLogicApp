# Description
A great logic game, also known as picross, nonogram, griddler, paint by number, and picgrid.

Reveal the underlying hidden picture by turning on the correct colored pixels based on numerical clues.  Remembers your progress for each unfinished puzzle to allow you to continue later on.  Very efficient touch interaction to achieve minimum solve times as well as unlimited undo.  Includes 30 black-n-white and color puzzles spanning 4 difficulty levels.  Additional puzzle packs available as in-app purchases for up to 10,000 more puzzles.

There are many griddler style apps out there, but this one is the best.  It concentrates on the game play, maximizes screen real estate, efficient touch interaction, and providing a very large puzzle library.
